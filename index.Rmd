# About the Project
Illicit drug use is a major public health issue in United States. Previous studies showed a relationship between illicit drug use and pop music [1][2], indicating that pop music may have a potential encouraging effect on illicit drug use [3]. However, these studies are either cross-sectional, or need to be reproduce using more recent data.

The intended final products will describe the trend of music genre, frequency of illicit drug in the popular music, and the relationship between popular music and illicit drug use.

# Website Overview
Data for this project includes two components: the Popular Music Data and the Illicit Drug Use Data. 
The Popular Music Data acquired from [Data on Songs from Billboard 1999-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019). The dataset contains the time of release, music genre, peak rank, and lyrics.

The dataset is for state-level small area estimates (SAEs), associated confidence intervals, and other key statistics related to state-level, model-based estimates of certain key substance use and mental health outcomes.
