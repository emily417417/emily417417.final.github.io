## Discussion

Overall, the findings for the popular music and illicit drug usage data is consistent with what we had originally hypothesized. Descriptively, we found that the frequency of substance description in popular music increases along with the substance usage in the age group of 18-25 over the years.

While we did find that most marijuana usage increases significantly during the period of 1999-2019, the frequency of binge drinking and alcohol usage do not have a significantly increased trend and are even decreaseingat national level, which is unexpected and interesting to learn. 

**Limitations**

Although the regression result and our plot indicate a positive association between popular music and substance, our analysis focus on the summarized data instead of individual level of data, thus the model construction is limited due to the simplified data quality. Also, the substance classification is done by string cast instead of manually classification, thus the quality of data is lacking accuracy and limited

## Conclusions

Overall, our findings shows a positive trend of substance use in age group of 18-25 during the period of 1999-2019, along with a increased frequency of substance description in the lyric of popular music.
